# Blog and personal page

This is my personal website which consists of blog and resume pages.

It was built with Jekyll by my friend [tragetraje](https://github/tragetraje) and uses heavily modified Jekyll Hyde theme by [mdo](https://github.com/mdo)

## Development

The site has two branches:

- `master` for development
- `gh-pages` for hosted site
