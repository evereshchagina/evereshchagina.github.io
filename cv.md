Development of silicon-based chemical sensors and actuators using CMOS/MEMS technology.   
During my PhD research, I focused on design, fabrication, and integration of a CMOS-based microsystem, comprising of the temperature sensors and heaters into a microfluidic channel for chemical sensing and analysis. My research project involved interdisciplinary subjects (CMOS/MEMS technology, microfluidics, sensors, heterogeneous catalysis) as well challenging processing in the clean room. The project goals were to fabricate, characterize and test chemical sensing and actuating properties of nano- and microstructured hot surface devices containing immobilized solid catalyst and integrated into the microfluidic platform to achieve controlled reaction conditions.
